# YumYum Meals App

A mobile application to favorite and filter meals based on preferences. A project from Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's Flutter Udemy course.

## Setup

Dart and Flutter will both need to be installed. Look to their docs for how to install/configure.

For running and editing, I personally recommend the following setup:
* Genymotion for virtual android device
* VSCode with Flutter/Dart extensions enabled
* Android Studio (Download this only for the SDK, just use VSCode for your editor)

VSCode and Genymotion ran exceptionally well with little configuration, whereas Android Studio's editor/virtual device manager completely ate up my machine's resources. There's probably a way to configure Android Studio to run more effectively, but the alternative was simpler for me to pick up and run with.

## VSCode helpers
* ctrl+shift+i: auto format
* ctrl+space: show available input options
* hover over property: shows info about object
* highlight -> format -> wrap in Container

After cloning the project, navigate into the root directory and run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter run`.
